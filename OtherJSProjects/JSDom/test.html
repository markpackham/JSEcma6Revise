    Unchanged the following gets outputted, so all fruits are shown while joe, car and star are ignored
    Any word with an r at the end gets ignored
    banana matches regex.
    apple matches regex.
    mandarin matches regex.
    However if I add "coconut" to the front of the list banana is removed whilst "coconut" and "joe" are added
    Also if I turn banana into "bananar" then "joe" gets added


    If I put "joe" at the front it will be returned no matter what the expression is

    Using test() on a regex with the global flag

If the regex has the global flag set, test() will advance the lastIndex of the regex. A subsequent use of test() will start the search at the substring of str specified by lastIndex (exec() will also advance the lastIndex property).
